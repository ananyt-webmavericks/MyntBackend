You help support the economy and job creation and are funding the future. By doing so, you may make an outsized return on your investment.\r\n                               Statistically, the more startup investments you make, the higher is the probability of you seeing better returns through your portfolio. Data collected across 10,000 Angellist portfolios support this idea. \r\n                             </p>\r\n                          </AccordionItemPanel>\r\n                      </AccordionItem>\r\n\r\n                      <AccordionItem>\r\n                          <AccordionItemHeading>\r\n                              <AccordionItemButton>\r\n                                  Who can invest?\r\n                              </AccordionItemButton>\r\n                          </AccordionItemHeading>\r\n                          <AccordionItemPanel>\r\n                              <p>\r\n                              Traditionally, investing in startups was not available to the general public. Only accredited investors had access to startup investment opportunities. But with Equity crowdfunding, the playing fields have been leveled. On platforms like MxI, anyone over the age of 18 can invest in early-stage companies in a matter of a few minutes!\r\n                              </p>\r\n                          </AccordionItemPanel>\r\n                 </AccordionItem>   \r\n                \r\n                      <AccordionItem>\r\n                          <AccordionItemHeading>\r\n                              <AccordionItemButton>\r\n                                  How will my money get to the startup?\r\n                              </AccordionItemButton>\r\n                          </AccordionItemHeading>\r\n                          <AccordionItemPanel>\r\n                              <p>\r\n                              Funds will be held in an Escrow account with one of our Banking Partners, which will be managed by SEBI-certified trustees, once you make an investment.

These startups have not been subjected to any due diligence by MXi. You may be able to request access to some private campaigns. Only if the founders approve your proposal can you review and invest.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </AccordionItemPanel>\r\n                    </AccordionItem>\r\n\r\n                      <AccordionItem >\r\n                        <AccordionItemHeading>\r\n                            <AccordionItemButton >\r\n                            When a deal is oversubscribed, what happens?\r\n                            </AccordionItemButton>\r\n                        </AccordionItemHeading>\r\n                        <AccordionItemPanel>\r\n                            <p>\r\n                            On the deal page, you can see when the minimum fundraising amount has been reached.

companies that raise on MXi set the terms for their agreement with investors.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        \r\n        <div className=\"col-md-12\">\r\n            <h3>What are you buying?</h3>\r\n            <ul>\r\n                <li>Most firms on MxI sell equity in the form of a convertible note, however, depending on the campaign type, you can also invest in debt or SAFEs.</li>\r\n                <li>Debt is, in essence, a loan. You, as the investor, buy promissory notes and take on the role of lender. The corporation must then repay your loan with interest within a defined time frame</li>\r\n                <li>Convertible notes are debt instruments that can be converted into stock. You purchase debt from the company and receive interest on it until the loan reaches its maturity date when it either converts to equity or is paid back to you in cash.</li>\r\n                <li>Convertible notes are a type of SAFE. Because SAFEs have no provisions for a cash payout, you, as an investor, are reliant on the SAFE converting to equity at some point in the future, which may or may not happen depending on whether the firm is acquitted or goes public. SAFE was created to be the financial tool you need without the headaches of general meetings or completing unneeded paperwork. It has precise information rights and easier exits, and it appreciates in value in the same way as stock shares do. If the startup is liquidated, a SAFE holder has priority over ordinary shareholders in terms of repayment.</li>           \r\n            </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"col-md-12\">\r\n            <h3>What exactly is M-SAFE?</h3>\r\n            <p>MXi's straightforward equity arrangement. An M-SAFE is a partnership agreement between investors and companies seeking funding. Individuals make investments with the hopes of earning a profit, whether in the form of company equity or cash distribution. The M-SAFE is an adapted version of the SAFE, a financial instrument invented by Y Combinator and widely utilized by angels and venture capitalists investing in startups all around the world. It's meant to function for investment campaigns with hundreds or even thousands of participants, and it's employed in various forms by several industry heavyweights.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"col-md-12\">\r\n            <h3>What is the mechanism behind it?</h3>\r\n            <p>Investors that use the M-SAFE receive a financial stake in the company but do not become equity holders right once. At the time of issue, it takes the legal form of Compulsorily Convertible Debentures ('CCDs'). When 'activation events,' such as an acquisition or an IPO, occur, these CCDs are converted into stock.</p>\r\n            <p>Risk Note: Activation events are not guaranteed. Investors should see them only as possibilities.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"col-md-12\">\r\n            <h3>How much money can I make?</h3>\r\n            <p>Your return is determined by the size of your investment, the company's exit valuation (how much it is worth at the moment), and the M-terms. SAFE's Investors put their money in at a very early stage, so their share is only affected by future occurrences.</p>\r\n            <p>Risk Note: If an activation event does not happen, you may never get a return on your investment.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"col-md-12\">\r\n            <h3>Terms of the M-SAFE</h3>\r\n            <p>Overview On trigger events such as a 100 percent secondary sale of CCDs, a buyback, or an IPO, this agreement issues compulsorily convertible debentures that convert into securities issued in future fundraising, such as equity shares or compulsorily convertible preference shares.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"col-md-12\">\r\n            <ul>\r\n            <li><b>Instrument</b>- Compulsorily Convertible Debentures (CCDs)</li>\r\n            <p><b>Conversion Events</b>- 100% secondary sale, Buyback, Acquisition, IPO</p>\r\n            <p><b>Cap Table</b></p>\r\n            <p><b>1.

Typically, startups just have to negotiate one item: the valuation cap or discount cap.</p>\r\n            <p><b>2.\tSafety First:</b> First and foremost, M-SAFE holders have priority over ordinary shareholders when it comes to repayment. A T-SAFE holder is paid before any other stakeholder if the startup is liquidated.</p>\r\n            <p><b>3.\tCheaper: </b> The legal costs are a bare minimum.</p>\r\n            <p><b>4.\tBenefits of Equity without any hassles:</b> M-SAFE is a financial instrument that eliminates the inconveniences of attending general meetings and signing superfluous paperwork.

The one who gives an authority to some trustable person is known as a principal or a donor. There are various situations in one's life where an individual possessing properties, bank accounts, etc. may not be in a position to perform his duties due to reasons like being abroad, physically ill, old in age etc. In such situations, if the transaction requires the presence of the individual who is not able to be present personally, then the only way out is to give the powers to act on behalf of the individual to another person. This is when a Power of Attorney deed is to be created.Download (Consent Form POA)</p>\r\n                \r\n                <p align=\"Left\">14.
